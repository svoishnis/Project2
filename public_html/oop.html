                <p>The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism<br></p>
                <h3><br>Encapsulation</h3>
                    <p>Encapsulation is when each object keeps its state private, inside a class. Other objects can only call a list of public functions, known as methods, and will not have direct access to this state unless permission was explicitly allowed.</p>

                <h3><br>Abstraction</h3>
                <p>Abstraction can be thought of as a natural extension of encapsulation.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Abstraction means that each object only exposes a high-level mechanism for using it. All implementation details are hidden and only relevant operations are visiable to the objects that use them</p>

                <h3><br>Inheritance</h3>
                <p>Inheritance is when you create a (child) class by deriving from another (parent) class. Thus creating a hierarchy. The child class reuses all fields and methods of the parent class (common part) and can implement its own (unique part).</p>

                <h3><br>Polymorphism</h3>
                <p>Polymorphism is when we have a parent class and a few child classes which inherit from it. This can be implemented  A collection or list — which contains a mix of all these classes, or through a method implemented for the parent class.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Polymorphism gives a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. Each child class keeps its own methods as they are.</p>

                <h3><br>Factory</h3>
                <p>The Factory Design Pattern is one of the most used design pattern in modern programming languages. It comes in different variants and implementations. Some common references are the "Factory Method" and "Abstract Factory".</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>This design pattern creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client and will only refer to the newly created object through a common interface.</p>

                <h3><br>Instantiation</h3>
                <p>Instantiation is the creation of an object or an “instance” of a given class. By referencing a class declaration, an instantiated object is named and created, and stored in memory.</p>

                <h3><br>Object</h3>
                <p>An object, is an abstract data type. Objects can include multiple properties and methods and may even contain other objects.</p>

                <h3><br>Class</h3>
                <p>A class is a user-defined data type, or blueprint for an object. Classes holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used through instantiation.</p>

                <h3><br>Namespace</h3>
                <p>A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups. In addition, namespaces prevent name collisions (when you want to reuse the same nameing for different classes or methods)</p>

                <h3><br>Constructor</h3>
                <p>A constructor is a special method of a class or structure that initializes a newly created object of that type. When the oject is created, the constructor is called automatically</p>

                <h3><br>Fixture</h3>
                <p>A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.</p>

                <h3><br>Type Hint</h3>
                <p>Type hinting means providing hints to function to only accept the given data type.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>In technical word we can say that Type Hinting is method by which we can force function to accept the desired data type.</p>

                <h3><br>Type Cast</h3>
                <p>Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.</p>

                <h3><br>Unit test</h3>
                <p>Unit testing are tests cases to cover all possible states and configurations of the software in order to discover bugs</p>

                <h3><br>Static</h3>
                <p>Statics refer to static member variable, which is a "class variable" of a statically defined class. For example: a member variable of a given class which is shared across all instances aka objects, and is accessible as a member variable of these objects.</p>

                <h3><br>Class method</h3>
                <p>An object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class. The object is the actual component of programs, while the class specifies how instances are created and how they behave. method: a method is an action which an object is able to perform.</p>

                <h3><br>Facade</h3>
                <p>Facade Method is a Structural Design pattern that provides a simpler unified interface to a more complex system. The word Facade means the face of a building or particularly an outer lying interface of a complex system, consists of several sub-systems.</p>

                <h3><br>Design patterns used</h3>
                <p>Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages.</p>

                <h3><br>Method</h3>
                <p>A method in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior; these comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of its various consumers.</p>

                <h3><br>Property</h3>
                <p>A property, in some object-oriented programming languages, is a special sort of class member, intermediate in functionality between a field (or data member) and a method.</p>
